 * Encapsulate a 433MHz receiver/transmitter pair (like the WLS107B4B
 * documented at [1]), where both the receiver (RX) and transmitter (TX)
 * are hooked up to the same JeeNode Port, like this:
 *  - JeeNode Port P (or +): VCC on TX
 *  - JeeNode Port +:        VCC on RX
 *  - JeeNode Port G:        GND on both TX and RX
 *  - JeeNode Port D:        Data In on TX
 *  - JeeNode Port A:        Data Out on RX
 *
 * The (now-discontinued) OOK 433 Plug from JeeLabs [2] conforms to this.
