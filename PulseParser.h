 * Nexa RF signals come in a couple of different formats, but they
 * generally consist of a SYNC waveform followed by a series of waveforms
 * representing data bits.
 *
 * This class processes incoming pulses - as produced by for example
 * RF433Transceiver::rx_get_pulse() - and generates pseudo-bit sequences
 * consisting of letters ('A', 'B') representing various SYNC pulses,
 * followed by strings of '1's and '0's representing data bits.
 *
 * The generated strings are pushed onto a RingBuffer, enabling the parser
 * to be run from an ISR.
